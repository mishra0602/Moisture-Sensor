Soil Moisture Sensor Circuit
This project demonstrates a soil moisture sensor circuit designed to monitor the moisture level of the soil. The circuit activates LEDs to indicate the soil's condition (wet or dry) and uses a solar panel for power. It was designed in Altium Designer.

The circuit uses:
Soil Moisture Probes: Detect the soil's moisture level.
Transistors (2N3904): Amplify the signal from the moisture probes.
Variable Resistor (VR1): Adjusts the sensitivity of the moisture sensor.
LEDs: Indicate the soil's moisture condition (LED1: dry, LED2: wet).
Solar Panel (6V 1W): Powers the circuit.
Zener Diode (6V): Stabilizes the voltage supply.

Circuit Operation
The probes measure the soil resistance.
When the soil is dry, resistance is high, triggering LED1.
When the soil is wet, resistance is low, triggering LED2.
